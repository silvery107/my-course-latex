# Collection of My Coursework in LaTex

This repo contains a collection of my coursework in LaTex format from my undergraduate to graduate schools, and some handy typings for lab group meetings.

This repo also serves as my workspace and template for local LaTex compilation. It contains a [sample setting](latex_workshop_extension_settings.json) of VsCode LaTex workshop extension which should also work with IEEE LaTex template.
